* PXE Booting, Remote Installation Services, Kickstart, Jumpstart, Autoyast in a box!
* Free!

## When would you use this?

* Perfect for your homelab! Easy reproducible automatic installations.
* Re-image your class-room systems from scratch
* Quickly setup a new VM system to test software
* Roll out an older OS to work with older documents or file-formats
* Setup new hardware via the network

## How Does it work?

The appliance mounts the installation media iso file you supply with your favorite operating system and
imports the necessary (network) boot-files. It creates a default configuration file for
your automated installation and starts hosting the operating system distribution files for
network booting.

Happy booting!
